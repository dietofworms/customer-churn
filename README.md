### Overview

Customer churn occurs in every business to consumer relationship and for the business, churn is an important metric to monitor. The relationship between business and consumer depends heavily on controllable factors such as billing, pricing, and quality of service among other things. Since these factors are controllable, the business can stop customers from leaving by understanding exactly why they would leave in the first place, hence predicting customer churn. 

The method for predicting customer churn is a supervised learning method using data from the past. More specifically, we find customers that have already churned (response) and their characteristics (predictors) before the churn occurred. Using this historical data, we fit a model that finds a relationship between the predictors to the reponse.
